**Bayesian Global Optimization (BGO)**


**BGO** is a Bayesian Global Optimization framework written in Python,
developed by Saul Toscano-Palmerin. The library
includes four different algorithms: Stratified Bayesian Optimization (SBO), 
Knowledge Gradient (KG), Expected Improvement (EI) and Probability Improvement (PI).
Please refer to the [Documentation][doc].

This library is still in development and soon we are going to include
examples where we need to decide how to optimally allocate
computational/experimental effort across information sources, to
optimize functions.

For one example optimized using this library, see [CitiBike][ref] and
[Description of the Citi Bike Simulator][annotated].
